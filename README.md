# meme-repository
I was once upon a time asked to make a shareable repository of all my memes. So why not? Let's give this a try.

## Evolution: Part 1
In and around July of 2019, around the time I was graduating from University -- @Lord-Zukofound my meme stash and decided he would make good use of GitHub's pull request feature to suggest new memes for the repository.

I would like to stress that this is the most encouraged way (then and more so, now) to suggest new memes for the upcoming site. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Around the same time as he made these suggestions, some friends of @MadIceTea suggested that a meme repository in GitHub on its own might not be so impressive to potential employers. So, the project was made private and put on hold for a while during a job hunt.

## Evolution: Part 2

In and around November 2019, with continued push/pull/outside pull requests into the repository and a joke that was simply getting out of hand -- @MadIceTea was finally hired. A couple weeks later, during Black Friday/Cyber Monday -- domains went on sale for very cheap prices. After asking his younger brother (and ultimately finding that all the good suggestions were already reserved domain names), the author achieved his dreams in taking the domain 'showmeame.me' (show me a meme) for this site.

Combined with a recent fortification in understanding in Javascript and webapps, a goal for this site will be to load a meme (perhaps chosen by an index value associated with each meme file and a randomizer function to choose one of the valid index numbers), upon the page's domready state. Each time the page refreshes (or in general, a new domready state is reached) then a new meme would be loaded.

The author is currently considering between native JS webapp coding and JS/ECMAScript6 HTML injection. Following this, likely some UI adjustments will be necessary. The author appreciates advice OR sample code in the issues/pull requests from experienced or challenge-loving persons.

## Evolution: Part 2a

Will likely start by finding an appropriate Hugo template and setting up a backend site in Netlify / mapping DNS.
